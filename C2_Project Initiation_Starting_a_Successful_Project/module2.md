### Determining project goals and deliverables
We need clear picture of what we are trying to accomplished how you're going to accomplish it, and how you know when it has been accomplished. 
- The project goal is the desired outcome of the project. Meaning that well-defined goals are clear and specific
- The project deliverables 
    - Or services that are created for the customer client, or project sponsor
    - What gets produced or presented at the end of a task event, or process
