# Definition project goals, scope, and success criteria

## Identifying project goals
### Determining project goals and deliverables
We need clear picture of what we are trying to accomplished how you're going to accomplish it, and how you know when it has been accomplished. 
- The project goal is the desired outcome of the project. Meaning that well-defined goals are clear and specific
- The project deliverables 
    - Or services that are created for the customer client, or project sponsor
    - What gets produced or presented at the end of a task event, or process
    - Help quantify and realize the impact of the project
    - An outcome produced at the end of a task, which can be an item or report that teammates present to stakeholders such as a presentation, chart, or graph

### SMART goals
- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**ttainable
- **R**elevant
- **T**ime-bound

#### Specific
- What do I want accomplish?
- Why is this a goal? The reason, purpose, or benefit
- Who is involved? or who is recipient?
- Where should the goal be delivered?
- To what degree?
#### Measurable
- How much?
- How many?
- How will I know when it's accomplished?
##### Metrics
- What you use to measure something like numbers or figures
##### Benchmarks or points of reference to make sure you're choosing accurate metrics
#### Attainable
- Can it reasonable be reached?
- How can it be accomplished? Break down the goal into smaller parts and see if it makes sense.
#### Relevant
- **Does the goal make sense?** In other words, does it make sense to try and reach this goal? Think about how the goal lines up with other goals, priorities and values. 
- **Is the goal worthwhile?** Does the effort involved balance out the benefits?
- **Is it the right time?** Consider the timing. Both the amount of time the project will take, as well as the larger economic and social contexts can have big impacts.
#### Time-bound (Deadline)
Deadlines give you a way to track your progress, otherwise, you may never reach your goal or never even get started.   
Making your goal time-bound gives you a way to break down how much needs to be accomplished over time.


### OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
OKRs help establish and clarify goals or objectives for an organization, department, project or person. OKRs take SMART goals a step further by combining a goal and more detailed metrics to determine a measurable outcome. Also, OKRs helps organizations set, track, and achieve their goals.

#### Objective:
- Defines what needs to be achieved
- Describes a desired outcome
#### Key Results
- The measurable outcomes that define when the objective has been met
#### Quick review
|Objective|Key Results|
|----------|-----------|
| - Similar to goals <br> - Describe a desired outcome| Define how you'll know whether or not you've met your objective|
#### OKR levels
- Company/Organization
- Department/Team
- Project

## Defining project scope
Scope helps ensure that your project is clearly defined and mapped out. That means knowing exactly who the project will be delivered to and who will be using the end result of the project.        
Scope also includes the project timeline, budget, and resources.        
A clearly defined scope describes all the details of a project and regulates what can be added or removed as it progresses. While it's ultimately the project manager's responsibility to monitor the project and make sure all the work and resources fall within its scope, team members and stakeholders can be encouraged to do their part by focusing on the task that are the most important to reaching the project's goal.  

### Gathering information to define scope
#### Asking scope-defining questions

Stakeholders
- How did you arrive at the decision to update the dining space? 
- Did the request originate from the restaurant owner, customers, or other stakeholders? 
- Who will approve the scope for the project? 

Goals
- What is the reason for updating the dining space? 
- What isn't working in the current dining space? 
- What is the end goal of this project? 

Deliverables
- Which dining space is being updated? 
- What exactly needs to be updated? 
- Does the dining space need a remodel? 

Resources
- What materials, equipment, and people will be needed? 
- Will we need to hire contractors? 
- Will we need to attain a floor plan and building permits? 

Budget
- What is the budget for this project? Is it fixed or flexible? 

Schedule
- How much time do we have to complete the project? 
- When does the project need to be completed? 

Flexibility
- How much flexibility is there? 

What is the highest priority: hitting the deadline, sticking to the budget, or making sure the result meets all the quality targets?
