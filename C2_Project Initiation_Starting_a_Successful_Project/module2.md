# Definition project goals, scope, and success criteria

## Identifying project goals
### Determining project goals and deliverables
We need clear picture of what we are trying to accomplished how you're going to accomplish it, and how you know when it has been accomplished. 
- The project goal is the desired outcome of the project. Meaning that well-defined goals are clear and specific
- The project deliverables 
    - Or services that are created for the customer client, or project sponsor
    - What gets produced or presented at the end of a task event, or process
    - Help quantify and realize the impact of the project
    - An outcome produced at the end of a task, which can be an item or report that teammates present to stakeholders such as a presentation, chart, or graph

### SMART goals
- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**ttainable
- **R**elevant
- **T**ime-bound

#### Specific
- What do I want accomplish?
- Why is this a goal? The reason, purpose, or benefit
- Who is involved? or who is recipient?
- Where should the goal be delivered?
- To what degree?
#### Measurable
- How much?
- How many?
- How will I know when it's accomplished?
##### Metrics
- What you use to measure something like numbers or figures
##### Benchmarks or points of reference to make sure you're choosing accurate metrics
#### Attainable
- Can it reasonable be reached?
- How can it be accomplished? Break down the goal into smaller parts and see if it makes sense.
#### Relevant
- **Does the goal make sense?** In other words, does it make sense to try and reach this goal? Think about how the goal lines up with other goals, priorities and values. 
- **Is the goal worthwhile?** Does the effort involved balance out the benefits?
- **Is it the right time?** Consider the timing. Both the amount of time the project will take, as well as the larger economic and social contexts can have big impacts.
#### Time-bound (Deadline)
Deadlines give you a way to track your progress, otherwise, you may never reach your goal or never even get started.   
Making your goal time-bound gives you a way to break down how much needs to be accomplished over time.


### OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
OKRs help establish and clarify goals or objectives for an organization, department, project or person. OKRs take SMART goals a step further by combining a goal and more detailed metrics to determine a measurable outcome. Also, OKRs helps organizations set, track, and achieve their goals.

#### Objective:
- Defines what needs to be achieved
- Describes a desired outcome
#### Key Results
- The measurable outcomes that define when the objective has been met
#### Quick review
|Objective|Key Results|
|----------|-----------|
| - Similar to goals <br> - Describe a desired outcome| Define how you'll know whether or not you've met your objective|
#### OKR levels
- Company/Organization
- Department/Team
- Project

## Defining project scope
Scope helps ensure that your project is clearly defined and mapped out. That means knowing exactly who the project will be delivered to and who will be using the end result of the project.        
Scope also includes the project timeline, budget, and resources.        
A clearly defined scope describes all the details of a project and regulates what can be added or removed as it progresses. While it's ultimately the project manager's responsibility to monitor the project and make sure all the work and resources fall within its scope, team members and stakeholders can be encouraged to do their part by focusing on the task that are the most important to reaching the project's goal.  

### Gathering information to define scope
#### Asking scope-defining questions

Stakeholders
- How did you arrive at the decision to update the dining space? 
- Did the request originate from the restaurant owner, customers, or other stakeholders? 
- Who will approve the scope for the project? 

Goals
- What is the reason for updating the dining space? 
- What isn't working in the current dining space? 
- What is the end goal of this project? 

Deliverables
- Which dining space is being updated? 
- What exactly needs to be updated? 
- Does the dining space need a remodel? 

Resources
- What materials, equipment, and people will be needed? 
- Will we need to hire contractors? 
- Will we need to attain a floor plan and building permits? 

Budget
- What is the budget for this project? Is it fixed or flexible? 

Schedule
- How much time do we have to complete the project? 
- When does the project need to be completed? 

Flexibility
- How much flexibility is there? 

What is the highest priority: hitting the deadline, sticking to the budget, or making sure the result meets all the quality targets? 


### Monitoring and maintaining a project's scope
What is scope creep? Changes, growth, and uncontrolled factors that affect a project scope at any point after the project begins

#### Sources of scope creep
|External| Internal|
|---------|---------|
|External sources of scope creep are easier to recognize <br> - Customer requests <br> - Env shifts <br> - Changes in technology| - Product improvements <br> - Processes changes
| There are some tips to keep in mind: <br> - Make project plans visible (make sure the stakeholders have visibility into the project. You want them to know the details of what's going to be produced, what resources are required, how much it will cost, and how much time it'll take.) <br> - Get clarity on project requirements (ask for constructive criticism of the initial product proposal. It's important to get this information before any contracts are signed.) <br> - Set ground rules and expectation for stakeholder involvement (Be sure to set ground rules and expectations for stakeholder involvement once the project gets started. Come to an agreement on each of your roles and responsibilities during execution and status reviews.) <br> - Once you're clear on the project scope, come up with a plan for how to deal with out-of-scope requests (Agree on who can make formal change requests and how those requests will be evaluated, accepted, and performed.) <br> - Be sure to get these agreements in writing (you'll always have documentation to point if you, a stakeholder, or the customer have a disagreement down the line.)| It's possible that a product developer will justify a decision on the grounds of making the product better, even though it's going to cost more, or a team lead might decide that a certain process is more efficient without realizing the impact the change in process will have on other team members tasked with different parts of the project. What you need to make clear to your team is that any change outside of the project scope comes off the bottom line, threatens the schedule, and increases risk.|


**Scope management best practices**
The scope of a project can get out of control quickly—so quickly that you may not even notice it. Scope creep is when a project’s work starts to grow beyond what was originally agreed upon during the initiation phase. Scope creep can put stress on you, your team, and your organization, and it can put your project at risk. The effects of scope creep can hinder every aspect of the project, from the schedule to the budget to the resources, and ultimately, its overall success. 

Here are some best practices for scope management and controlling scope creep: 

- **Define your project’s requirements.** Communicate with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project and document those requirements during the initiation phase. 
- **Set a clear project schedule.** Time and task management are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. Your schedule should outline all of your project’s requirements and the tasks that are necessary to achieve them.
- **Determine what is out of scope.** Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team understand when proposed changes are out of scope. Come to a clear agreement about the potential impacts to the project and document your agreement. 
- **Provide alternatives.** Suggest alternative solutions to your customer or stakeholder. You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. Perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary.
- **Set up a change control process.** During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.
- **Learn how to say no.** Sometimes you will have to say no to proposed changes. Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. If you are asked to take on additional tasks, explain how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements. 
- **Collect costs for out-of-scope work.** If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to document all costs incurred. That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the increased scope. Be sure to indicate what the charges are for. 


### Managing changes to a project's scope
As the project manager is to deliver the project according to the scope agreements. This includes delivering the project within the given deadline and the approved budget. You'll quickly find that this is easier said than done. As you progress through your project, you will continually need to make compromises and weigh trade-offs as new challenges and changes and factors present themselves. Any time a team member takes on an unplanned task, more is lost than just the time spent working on that task. In order to decide if a scope change is acceptable and what impact it will have, project managers usually refer to the triple constraint model. The triple constraint model is the combination of the three most significant restrictions of any project: scope, time, and cost. 

- Time refers to the project schedule and deadlines. 
- Cost includes the budget, and it also covers resources and the people who will work on the project.       

-> Both time and budget have to be carefully managed alongside scope. All three of these are linked; you can't change one without having an impact on the others.
