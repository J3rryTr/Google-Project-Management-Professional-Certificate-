- **Flexibility** is important for adapting to the changes and challenges (ambiguity) that come up in projects. To boost your flexibility, try these strategies:
    - **Assess external constraints**: Factor in things like holidays and time off when planning.
    - **Plan for risks and challenges**: Proactively consider potential problems and their solutions.
    - **Calculate "float" in your schedule**: Identify the amount of time a task can be delayed without impacting the project timeline.

- **Handling ambiguity** is crucial, as project goals, requirements, and other aspects can be unclear. Here's how to guide your team through uncertainty:
    - **Keep calm**: Your composure can inspire the team.
    - **Express empathy**: Show understanding for the challenges your team members are facing.
    - **Communicate clearly**: Define what is confirmed about the project to provide a sense of stability.
    - **Make decisions and stick to them (when possible)**: Avoid second-guessing to reduce uncertainty.
    - **Trust your team's expertise**: Encourage open discussion to leverage everyone's knowledge and identify information gaps.

#### Key interpersonal skills
- **Communication**: This is about clearly conveying information and actively listening to your teammates. Think of it as keeping everyone on the same page.
- **Negotiation**: It's not always about getting your way, but finding a compromise that works for everyone involved.
- **Conflict Mediation**: Disagreements happen! This skill is about helping teammates resolve conflicts constructively.
- **Understanding Motivations**: Everyone is driven by different things. This skill is about figuring out what motivates each teammate to do their best work.
