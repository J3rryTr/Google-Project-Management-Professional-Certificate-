# Introduction: The project management life cycle and methodologies

## Understanding the project life cycle

### The project life cycle
- Initiation: This is where the project takes shape. You define the goals, determine the scope, and gather resources. It's like laying the foundation for a house.
- Planning: Now, you create a detailed plan outlining how to achieve the project goals. This includes scheduling tasks, allocating resources, and establishing communication channels. Think of it as creating blueprints for your project.
- Execution: This is where the action happens! The team works together to complete the tasks outlined in the plan. You monitor progress, address any roadblocks, and ensure everything stays on track.
- Closure: Once all tasks are complete, you formally close the project. This involves documenting lessons learned, celebrating successes, and handing over the deliverables to the stakeholders.



### Analyzing the different project phases
Initiate the project
- Define project goals
- Determine resources, people, and other project details
- Get project approval

Make a plan
- Create a budget 
- Set a schedule 
- Establish your team 
- Determine roles and responsibility 
- Plan for risk and change
- Establish communications 

Executing & complete tasks
- Mange the progress
- Communicate
- Make adjustments

Closing project 
- Ensure all tasks have been completed
- Confirm acceptance of the project outcome
- Reflect on lessons learned
- Communicate results with stakeholders
- Celebrate completing the project

#### The project life cycle
- Initiate the project   
In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

    - Who are the stakeholders?
    - What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
    - What is the purpose and mission of the project?
    - What are the measurable objectives for the team?
    - What is the project trying to improve? 
    - When does this project need to be completed? 
    - What skills and resources will the project require? 
    - What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

- Make a plan   
In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 

    - Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  
    - Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

- Execute the project       
In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action. 

    - Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
    - Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
    - Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
    - Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
    - Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

- Close the project     
In this phase, close out the project.

    - Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes. 
    - Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.
    - Take time with your team to celebrate your successes! 
    - Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.
    - Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.
    - Reflect on ways to improve in the future.



### Comparing project management methodologies and approaches
| |Waterfall|Agile|
|-----|--------|---------|
| Project manager's role| Project manager serves as an active leader by prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members| Scrum Master acts primarily as a facilitator, removing any barriers the team faces. <br> Team shares more responsibility in managing their own work.|  
| Scope| Project deliverables and plans are well-established and documented in the early stages of initiating and planning. Changes go through a formal change request process.| Planning happens in shorter iterations and focuses on delivering value quickly. Subsequent iterations are adjusted in response to feedback or unforeseen issues.|
| Schedule| Follows a mostly linear path through the initiating, planning, executing, and closing phases of the project.| Time is organized into phases called Sprints. Each Sprint has a defined duration, with a set list of deliverables planned at the start of the Sprint.|
| Cost| Costs are kept under control by careful estimation up front and close monitoring throughout the life cycle of the project.| Costs and schedule could change with each iteration.|
| Quality| Project manager makes plans and clearly defines criteria to measure quality at the beginning of the project.| Team solicits ongoing stakeholder input and user feedback by testing products in the field and regularly implementing improvements.|
| Communication| Project manager continually communicates progress toward milestones and other key indicators to stakeholders, ensuring that the project is on track to meet the customer’s expectations.| Team is customer-focused, with consistent communication between users and the project team.|
| Stakeholders| Project manager continually manages and monitors stakeholder engagement to ensure the project is on track.| Team frequently provides deliverables to stakeholders throughout the project. Progress toward milestones is dependent upon stakeholder feedback.|
| Advantage| - Simple and straightforward: easy to understand and manage especially for linear projects. <br> - Clear documentation: Emphasis on upfront planning leads to well-defined requirements and documentation. <br> - Well-defined milestones: Provides a clear understanding of project progress and timelines.| - Flexibility and adaptability: Iterative nature allows for adjustments based on feedback and changing requirements. <br> - Early and continuous feedback: Frequent stakeholder input reduces the risk of delivering a product that doesn't meet needs. <br> - Better suited for complex projects: Embraces change and allows for course correction throughout the project lifecycle.|
| Disadvantages| - Inflexibility: Difficult to accommodate changes once a phase is complete.<br> - Limited stakeholder feedback: Feedback is primarily gathered at specific points, potentially leading to late-stage surprises.<br> - Higher risk for complex projects: Unforeseen issues can cause significant delays and rework.| - Requires experienced and collaborative teams: Success depends on strong communication and self-management.<br> - Less predictable timelines: Iterative nature can make it challenging to define precise deadlines early on.<br> - Documentation may be less comprehensive: Focus on delivering working products may result in less detailed documentation.

#### Lean and Six Sigma methodologies
| | Lean| Six Sigma|
|-------|---------|----------|
|Definition| Often referred to as Lean Manufacturing because it originated in the manufacturing world. The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production. | A methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.|
|Methodology| - Lack of proper documentation <br> - Lack of process standards <br> - Not understanding the customers’ needs <br> - Lack of effective communication <br> - Lack of process control <br> - Inefficient process design <br> - Failures of management| - Always focus on the customer. <br> - Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens. <br> - Make your processes flow smoothly. <br> - Reduce waste and concentrate on value. <br> - Stop defects by removing variation. <br> - Involve and collaborate with your team. <br> - Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.|
|Implement|  Use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits. You can achieve this by using the pillars of the Lean 5S quality tool. The term 5S refers to the five pillars that are required for good housekeeping: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain. Implementing the 5S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material. The 5S method includes these five steps: <br>  - Sort: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. <br>  - Set in order: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. <br>  - Shine: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day. <br>  - Standardize: Perform the process in the same way every time. <br>  - Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.| Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are measurable like time, cost, or quantity. Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard. Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon.|



##### Popular project management approaches
Below is a brief recap of some of the project management approaches you’ve been introduced to so far:

**Waterfall** is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.

**Agile** involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.

**Scrum** is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.

**Kanban** is a tool used in both Agile and Lean approaches that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”

**Lean** uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste. Lean implements a Kanban scheduling system to manage production.

**Six Sigma** involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.

**Lean Six Sigma** is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems. The 5S organization framework, the DMAIC process, and the use of Kanban boards are all components of this approach. 

Despite their differences, all of these project management methodologies require communication and collaboration among various teams and aim to deliver projects on time and within budget.
