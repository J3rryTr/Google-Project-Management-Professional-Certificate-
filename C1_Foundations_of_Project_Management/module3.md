# Introduction: The project management life cycle and methodologies

## Understanding the project life cycle

### The project life cycle
- Initiation: This is where the project takes shape. You define the goals, determine the scope, and gather resources. It's like laying the foundation for a house.
- Planning: Now, you create a detailed plan outlining how to achieve the project goals. This includes scheduling tasks, allocating resources, and establishing communication channels. Think of it as creating blueprints for your project.
- Execution: This is where the action happens! The team works together to complete the tasks outlined in the plan. You monitor progress, address any roadblocks, and ensure everything stays on track.
- Closure: Once all tasks are complete, you formally close the project. This involves documenting lessons learned, celebrating successes, and handing over the deliverables to the stakeholders.



### Analyzing the different project phases
Initiate the project
- Define project goals
- Determine resources, people, and other project details
- Get project approval

Make a plan
- Create a budget 
- Set a schedule 
- Establish your team 
- Determine roles and responsibility 
- Plan for risk and change
- Establish communications 

Executing & complete tasks
- Mange the progress
- Communicate
- Make adjustments

Closing project 
- Ensure all tasks have been completed
- Confirm acceptance of the project outcome
- Reflect on lessons learned
- Communicate results with stakeholders
- Celebrate completing the project

#### The project life cycle
- Initiate the project   
In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

    - Who are the stakeholders?
    - What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
    - What is the purpose and mission of the project?
    - What are the measurable objectives for the team?
    - What is the project trying to improve? 
    - When does this project need to be completed? 
    - What skills and resources will the project require? 
    - What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

- Make a plan   
In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 

    - Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  
    - Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

- Execute the project       
In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action. 

    - Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
    - Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
    - Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
    - Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
    - Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

- Close the project     
In this phase, close out the project.

    - Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes. 
    - Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.
    - Take time with your team to celebrate your successes! 
    - Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.
    - Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.
    - Reflect on ways to improve in the future.



### Comparing project management methodologies and approaches
| |Waterfall|Agile|
|-----|--------|---------|
| Project manager's role| Project manager serves as an active leader by prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members| Scrum Master acts primarily as a facilitator, removing any barriers the team faces. <br> Team shares more responsibility in managing their own work.|  
| Scope| Project deliverables and plans are well-established and documented in the early stages of initiating and planning. Changes go through a formal change request process.| Planning happens in shorter iterations and focuses on delivering value quickly. Subsequent iterations are adjusted in response to feedback or unforeseen issues.|
| Schedule| Follows a mostly linear path through the initiating, planning, executing, and closing phases of the project.| Time is organized into phases called Sprints. Each Sprint has a defined duration, with a set list of deliverables planned at the start of the Sprint.|
| Cost| Costs are kept under control by careful estimation up front and close monitoring throughout the life cycle of the project.| Costs and schedule could change with each iteration.|
| Quality| Project manager makes plans and clearly defines criteria to measure quality at the beginning of the project.| Team solicits ongoing stakeholder input and user feedback by testing products in the field and regularly implementing improvements.|
| Communication| Project manager continually communicates progress toward milestones and other key indicators to stakeholders, ensuring that the project is on track to meet the customer’s expectations.| Team is customer-focused, with consistent communication between users and the project team.|
| Stakeholders| Project manager continually manages and monitors stakeholder engagement to ensure the project is on track.| Team frequently provides deliverables to stakeholders throughout the project. Progress toward milestones is dependent upon stakeholder feedback.|
| Advantage| Simple and straightforward: easy to understand and manage especially for linear projects

[//]<> (Waterfall:

Advantages:

Simple and straightforward: Easy to understand and manage, especially for linear projects.
Clear documentation: Emphasis on upfront planning leads to well-defined requirements and documentation.
Well-defined milestones: Provides a clear understanding of project progress and timelines.
Disadvantages:

Inflexibility: Difficult to accommodate changes once a phase is complete.
Limited stakeholder feedback: Feedback is primarily gathered at specific points, potentially leading to late-stage surprises.
Higher risk for complex projects: Unforeseen issues can cause significant delays and rework.
Agile:

Advantages:

Flexibility and adaptability: Iterative nature allows for adjustments based on feedback and changing requirements.
Early and continuous feedback: Frequent stakeholder input reduces the risk of delivering a product that doesn't meet needs.
Better suited for complex projects: Embraces change and allows for course correction throughout the project lifecycle.
Disadvantages:

Requires experienced and collaborative teams: Success depends on strong communication and self-management.
Less predictable timelines: Iterative nature can make it challenging to define precise deadlines early on.
Documentation may be less comprehensive: Focus on delivering working products may result in less detailed documentation.)
